The ^/primary folder is a dump of the code associated with my graduate thesis work.

The ^/old_proj folder is the code from UMBC CS621 projects.  I worked jointly with Mike Corbin on those.

This repo is public, but not necessarily useful.  Also, if there is a twitter application secret in here, it's no longer valid anyway.
