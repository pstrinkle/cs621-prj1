# This tries to build a 3-gram level histogram (sketch) for each
# day's tweets.
#
# This opens the ~xml file holding the tweets, and builds a giant
# tweet for each day, by appending the previous day's tweets.
#
# My goal is tokenize the string and then remove the words that aren't.

# TODO: Add command line parameters.
