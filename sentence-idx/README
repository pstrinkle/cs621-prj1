This script is used to generate data for the word->sentence index.
It builds the word->sentence index in the mapper
There is no reducer script -- each (word, sentence) pair is put on its
own record. So the reducer is just 'cat'.

To run this streaming script, just use the 'run-indexer' shell script in this
directory.

e.g.,


./run-indexer bible

... will process the 'bible' directory on HDFS and emit an output in 'bible_idx'
