\section{Introduction}
The assignment was to build a distributed solution to the problem of calculating information about a file F.  We had to determine x, y, and z.

\section{Background}
Distributed systems do a, b, and c.

\subsection{Hadoop}
Our system was implemented using Hadoop.  The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) automatically do cool things like spreading files, replication, etc.

\subsection{MapReduce}
We wrote mapreduce stuff to do this.

\section{Implementation}
Our average and max, min and such are calculated as such.
